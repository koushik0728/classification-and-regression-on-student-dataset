## Classification and Regression on Student Dataset 

This project applies multiple **classification and regression algorithms** to predict and analyze student performance using data from the UCI Student Performance dataset.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption)
- **File Used**: `student-mat.csv`

##  Machine Learning Algorithms Used

### Regression Models:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor

### Classification Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Workflow
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Encoding
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation Analysis
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Performance Comparison

## Results
Models were evaluated using:
- Regression: MAE, MSE, RÂ²
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall
